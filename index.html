        <h2 class="info__title">Who was Chico Mendes?</h2>
        <p>
          Chico Mendes was born on December 15, 1944, in the seringal (rubber
          tapping fields) of Porto Rico, near the border of Acre with Bolivia,
          in the town of Xapuri, Acre state. The son of a rubber tapper himself,
          Chico's childhood was spent next to his father tapping the seringal
          trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Life in the seringal instilled in the young rubber tapper a sense of
          revolt against injustice. The economic activity of extracting rubber
          in the Amazon has always been marked by unfair working relations. The
          system of trading industrial merchandise for extracted materials
          created a culture of permanent debt and poverty. Rebellions were
          suffocated by the violence of police officers. The seringal
          landowners, seeking to routinely keep the rubber tappers in
          submission, would punish any demonstrations of disrespect with
          physical violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Differently from other sergingueiros, Chico was taught how to read,
          write and think by Euclides Fernandes Távora, a political refugee that
          lived close to Chico's settlement. This fact would become decisive in
          Chico's life. When the first unions in Acre began to form, Chico was
          aware that it was time to change the reality in the seringal. In 1975
          he joined the board of directors of Brasileia Rural Worker's Union,
          the first created in Acre, presided by the combative leader Wilson
          Pinheiro.
        </p>
        <p>
          The situation of Acre was critical in the 1970's. Amazon economic
          policy set by the military regime led to serious conflicts over land
          issues. Economic activity began to switch rubber for the raising of
          cattle which resulted in predatory land practices and the
          deforestation of large swaths of land hindering the rubbertapper's
          ability to remain living in the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1976, under the leadership of Wilson Pinheiro, the rubber tappers
          came up with the idea of "empates," protests against deforestation:
          they would gather their families and go to threatened areas, dismantle
          camps set up by loggers, and stop the chainsaws. As a result of this
          resistance movement, in 1980 Wilson Pinheiro was murdered inside the
          Union offices in Brasiléira.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1983 Chico was elected union President in Xapuri and the fight for
          rubbertapper rights intensified. The main issues vindicated were
          defense of the forest and worker's rights, a challenge to the military
          dictatorship of the time.
        </p>
        <img class="img__desc" src="/assets/001.jpg" alt="trade union" />
        <p>
          Chico's life lived in symbiosis with the forest stimulated his
          curiosity and led to a theory of this creation which, later in life,
          would be proved to be true: that benefits derived from keeping the
          forest standing were greater than taking it down.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was this respect for the forest together with his ideology, molded
          by his experience with unionism and the need to defend human rights,
          that marked Chico Mendes as a political leader who transcended his
          location and became a respected international figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1985 Chico spearheaded the organization of the First National
          Rubbertapper Assembly. More than 100 rubbertappers created the
          National Rubbertappers Council as a representative entity and
          elaborated a unique solution for Agrarian Reform: the Extractive
          Reserves.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the National Assembly, the plight of the rubbertappers began to
          be known. Its international projection was the result of a documentary
          produced by Adrian Cowell, an English cinematographer who filmed the
          National Assembly and decided to accompany Chico in his day to day
          activities. In 1987 he released around the world the documentary
          entitled “I Want to Live” which showcased Chico's fight to protect the
          forest and worker's rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between 1987 and 1988 Chico Mendes was awarded with the Global 500, a
          United Nations award, in England, as well as the Environment Medal by
          the Better World Society, in the United States. He was interviewed by
          the major news publications of the world and journalists and
          researchers alike visited the rubber tapping fields, divulging his
          ideas across the Globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more Chico Mendes gained international acclaim, however, the more
          he became threatened back home in Xapuri. The empates were leading to
          prison time. Promised reforms to resolve land issues would not take
          place. The idea of creating Extractive Reserves moved at a snail's
          pace in Congress.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 22nd, 1988 Chico Mendes was ambushed in his own backyard
          and killed by a henchman hired by Darly Alves, a land invader with a
          history of violence all around Brasil.

        <p>
          Repercussion was immediate around the world. Revolt was strong and
          followed in Brasil. The Brazilian press, which up until this point
          ignored the plight of rubbertappers and would hardly ever mention
          Chico Mendes, looked to make up for lost time. The strong reaction and
          pressure of public opinion lead to the incarceration of the criminals
          who killed Chico, a fact uncommon of in rural Brasil.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first Extractive Reserves were created in March of 1990,
          eliminating conflicts, and cementing Chico Mende's dream of seeing the
          Forest valued and assuring a future for the children of rubbertappers
          and extractivists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main legacy of Chico Mendes are the Extractive Reserves,
          representing a first initiative towards reconciliation between the
          environment and social justice, antecipating the concept of
          sustainable development arising with Rio 92.
